# simple_round
A simple python command line script to round numbers in any text, 
This simple script can come in handy and save time if there are many numbers in text files such as latex and you would like to round them. I have not tested extensively this script though, use at your own risk/ or test it before using ÔÅä :)  . 

To use (args, inputfile, outputfile, number of digits to keep while rounding): 

python round.py input_talext_table_file.txt output_file.txt 3
